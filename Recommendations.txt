Recommendation 1: Aggressive Pricing and Exclusive Partnerships
Target should adopt an aggressive pricing strategy to attract price-sensitive customers and increase its market share. Enhancing product variety can meet a broader range of consumer needs and preferences. Additionally, forming partnerships with reputable companies to launch exclusive product versions can differentiate Target from competitors, enhancing its brand as a unique shopping destination and potentially increasing customer loyalty and sales.

Recommendation 2: Enhancing Variety in In-House Brands
Target's in-house brands would benefit from an expanded and diversified product lineup. This approach caters to a wider array of consumer preferences, maintaining interest and enhancing satisfaction. Ensuring consistent stock availability is crucial to prevent sales losses to competitors due to out-of-stock issues. This strategy will strengthen the appeal of Targetâ€™s brands and encourage more frequent purchases.

Recommendation 3: Enhancing the Online Shopping Experience
While Target's online shopping experience is generally positive, there is room for improvement to compete with platforms like Amazon. Expanding the online product range and ensuring consistent availability are key. Additionally, promoting the website and mobile app can attract a larger customer base. Improving the online interface and navigation will make shopping more intuitive, and increased marketing can drive traffic and conversions, helping Target appeal to convenience-focused shoppers.
